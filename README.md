### Concurrently

Using concurrently npm package to run both the server and React front end for development. Other option would be to separate front-end into a unique repsository deployed to S3 and Node backend on Heroku

### Font-End
React JS front-end of this app is under the /client folder with it's own package.json/webpack configuration. These will eventually be separated.

### Running Entire Stack on Heroku

TODO: Heroku deployment and remote build instructions to go here

TODO: ENV configuration for production deployment vs. dev

TODO: client/.env for Heroku production vars (don't forget .gitignore for security)
