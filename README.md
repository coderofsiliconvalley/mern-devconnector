### Concurrently

Using concurrently npm package to run both the server and React front end for development. Other option would be to separate front-end into a unique repsository deployed to S3 and Node backend on Heroku

### Font-End
React JS front-end of this app is under the /client folder with it's own package.json/webpack configuration. These will eventually be separated.
